Sometimes I write small metaprograms to figure something out.
Sometimes I just put them in whatever scratch file I happen to have lying around.
Sometimes I want to rerun an old metaprogram or see how I did something in an old metaprogram.
Sometimes I have lost the metaprogram by then.

Maybe this repository will help.

I am not good or experienced at metaprogramming and these programs are meant to be run only once,
so don't expect them to work very well.
